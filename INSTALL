How to install pi-gpio
=======================
The recommended installation method is to download the latest Release .deb file from
https://github.com/Milliways2/pi-gpio/releases/latest  
This has both hf (32bit) & 64 bit versions and python libraries (but not examples)
which can be installed with

	sudo dpkg -i pi-gpio_….deb

The examples can be downloaded from:-	
	https://github.com/Milliways2/pi-gpio/tree/main/examples

How to build from source
========================
The easiest way is to use the supplied 'build' script:

	./build

Alternatively  use the supplied Makefile or 'build' script in the source directory:

	sudo make install

That should do a complete install of pi-gpio

How to create an installable Debian Software Package file
=========================================================

	Run ./buildDEB

This will create a pi-gpio_….deb file for the current architecture which can be installed:-

	sudo dpkg -i pi-gpio_….deb

It is recommended to install from a .deb file.

The Release .deb files can be downloaded from https://github.com/Milliways2/pi-gpio/releases/latest  
If pi-gpio has been locally installed this should be removed using the uninstall script.

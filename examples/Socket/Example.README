These programs are designed to test/demonstrate the pi-sock library

	bench-pi-gpioS.c	Toggles a GPIO pin and measures rate
	DS3231S.c		Display status of DS3231 RTC

GPIO programs
	testS.c			Test socket equivalents of pi-gpio functions

These don't do anything "useful" - use as examples to build your application.

pi-sock.c is provided to compile on remote system (requires changes to Makefile & #include)
